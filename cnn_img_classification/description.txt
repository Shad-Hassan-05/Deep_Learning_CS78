Code for a CNN that classifies images in a data set.
The dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-dtVe1I20cerLO_eILC2Ep69XID_xCCs/view?usp=sharing. 
My CS78 professor wrote a lot of this code. 
My contributions are the actual design of the model, the training policy, and the creation of the dataset.
