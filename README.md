# Deep Learning CS78
My solutions to the psets CS78 taught in the fall of 2025. In these three projects, I built a basic neural network, a convolutional network, and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. Some of the code is provided by my professor; however, the structural code and training code were my contribution.
