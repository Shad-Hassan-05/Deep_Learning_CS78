# Deep Learning CS78
My solutions to the psets CS78 taught in the fall of 2025. In these three projects I build a basic neural network, a convolutional network, and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. Some of the code is provided by my professor, however the strucural code and training code was my contribution.
